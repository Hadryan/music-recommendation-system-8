# music-recommendation-system ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=idevesh.music-recommendation-system&style=flat-square&color=0088cc)
This project is a basic model on how a recommendation system works for the Music recommendation. 
I used decision tree classifier in this model and reached a desirable accuracy according to the Dataset created by me.

## Usage
1. Just Copy the files in your directory.
2. Now open the music.ipynb file in jupyter notebook.
3. run all the cells and check the accuracy of predictions.

### NOTE: The accuracy can fluctuate between 50% - 100% due to less amount of data being trained you can use more data to imporve its accuracy.
